As a user, I want to be able to choose the dish to cook based on available ingredients, so I have some proven algorithms to get a lunch (dinner).
As a user, I want the recipes list could be ordered by value of calorie, so I can choose the right dish according my dietary preferences.
As a user, I want the list of measures for product and instructions in a recipe be available both in imperial and continental scales, so I can share my favorite recipes with my friends from the whole world.
As a user I want to easily get the shopping list out of my recipe, so I can arrange the visit to a grocery store in the most effective way.

As a developer I want to use unlimited power of full-stack application, so I can interact with external APIs, store data on server side in DB, and use templating engines to deliver consistent experience for the user.
